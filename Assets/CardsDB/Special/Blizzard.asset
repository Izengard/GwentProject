  Description: The blizzard roars in from the north, a furious tempest of snow and
    ice. The sky darkens with the wrath of the storm, as daylight is devoured by
    the swirling white fury. Icicles form like jagged teeth on every ledge, and the
    wind howls with a piercing chill, heralding the arrival of an unstoppable force.
