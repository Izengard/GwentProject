  Description: "When the Carrier ascends, its shimmering engines ignite, and it becomes
    a star unto itself. The void bends around it, and the fabric of reality quivers.
    The Carrier\u2019s purpose is twofold: to protect and to avenge. It is the wrath
    of Aiur incarnate, a celestial arbiter that dispenses justice across the cosmic
    expanse."
